## About the course 

Web Development by Neil Mispelaar gives students a deep understanding of HTML5 technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), with stops along the way to cover accessibility (a11y), usability, performance, and a multitude of user experience design consideration. We will also demistify the world of client side front end development by exploring JavaScript libraries and frameworks to provide a basic foundation that can be further built on after the course. 

The world of web development simply moves too fast, and is too vast to cover everything in a single semester course. The goal however is provide students with a solid baseline foundation of today's technology that they can build on in the future.

## About the slides

This course is all about Web Development, so it seemed like an awesome opportunity to leverage the power of the web to build and ship lecture slides.

[Slidev](https://github.com/slidevjs/slidev) is an awesome tool that allows you to write slides in markdown and leverage themes and styles that are then applied to your content. 

Here is a better description from their website: 

> Slidev aims to provide the flexibility and interactivity for developers to make their presentations even more interesting, expressive, and attractive by using the tools and technologies they are already familiar with.
