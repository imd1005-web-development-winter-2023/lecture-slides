# Design thinking is a human-centered approach for solving complex problems with the end user in mind. 

<!-- 

Slide notes: 

* Design thinking is a collaborative framework where people come together to try to solve complex problems
* They are trying to solve these problems for the customer / user
* So what does design thinking look like?...

* You're not your users!

# Empathize
What are the biggest pain points of your users

* To create a desirable product for our users we need to understand who they are and what they need
* Start by defining the people are going to be using this product
* Empathise with them, their situations, and challenges they may face
* Then identify what their biggest pain points are


<!-- 

Slide notes: 

* In industry, during this phase you could go out and interview users, or conduct surveys, send out questionairres or perform some research activities with users 
* Sometimes that's not always possible and so you have to make best guesses and assumptions
* Remember - you are not trying to find solutions to their problems here, you are just trying to identify the pain points

# Define
Perform research to understand the problem that should be solved

* Learn as much as you can about the end user and the context of the problems they have 
* Perform a competitive analysis on other comparative websites
* Identify which problems have the highest impact on the users
* Pull in the context and information from everywhere else 
* Define the user problems that we want to solve

# Ideate
Start thinking about solutions

* Now that we have the problem defined, we can think about really creative solutions
* Start by generating as many ideas as possible 
* These ideas could be captured as sketches 
* The sketches that hold the most promise could then me turned into wireframes

<!-- 

Slide notes: 

* This is where you can really get creative

# Prototype
Turn your idea into a prototype

* Once you have visualized your solutions, you can turn them into high fidelity prototypes
* High fidelity prototypes don't need to be functional, they can just be images

# Test
Test with actual users

* Put your high fidelity prototypes in front of actual users
* If you can't find actual users, try colleagues, friends, neighbours, anyone really
* Use the feedback to determine if you have addressed the main user pain points
