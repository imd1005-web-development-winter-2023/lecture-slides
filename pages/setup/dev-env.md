# Tools
What we need

|   |**Tool**|**Mandatory**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|[VSCode&nbsp;Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com)|No|Industry standard code editor. You don't have to use this one, any code editor will do, but this is my favourite.|
|2|[Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)|No|VSCode extention that automatically formats your code. Save's time and if you are working in a large team - ensures everyone formats their code in the same way.|
|3|[Git](https://git-scm.com)|Yes|Time travel but for files. This is a must.|
|4|[Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)|Yes|JavaScript engine for running local dev tools and building modern software. We'll unpack this later, but for now you just know that you will need it.|
|5|[NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)|No|NPM = Node Package Manager. This helps us download other tools and resources that we'll use in our own apps. It comes automatically with Node JS. You may also choose to use yarn if you'd prefer, but note that we're using NPM in future code samples.|
