# Assignment 1
DRAFT: Research project - designing a small website

🎉 Congratulations! You made it! After graduating from the Interactive Multimedia & Design (IMD) program you were immediately hired by a small but up-and-coming Creative Agency called the Shinra Creative Company (SCC).

And before you even adjusted the height of your office's new standing desk to the way that you like it, your Team Lead tells you that Shinra Creative has a client that needs a new website.

Your Team Lead introduces you to Aeris, the new client, and asks you to design a website and create a presentation that not only presents the website design to the client, but also demonstrates a detailed analysis of:

* the users of the website,
* the key problem(s) that they are experiencing,
* the tasks that they are looking to accomplish on this site
* how the website design solves the task

<!--

Slide notes: 

* I'm Neil Mispelaar
* Pronouns he / him
* I'm a seniors dev at Stats Can. I've been with the public service for too many years 
* I've also done some private sector work and consulting, but my main calling is the GoC 
* My last name is a bit of pain for people to say so you can just call me Neil 
* That's a picture of me in my Code for Canada jacket - we'll talk more about that later
* If you ever want to start a fight with developers online, just say what framework you use - people get very defensive - I don't get it - and I'm not trying to pick a fight with anyone - just being open and transparent
