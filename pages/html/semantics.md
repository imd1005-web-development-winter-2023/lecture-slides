# Semantic elements
The elements

* `<header>` — for more important information, like the masthead of the website, where the name and logo and navigation are
* `<nav>` — navigation, defining the navigation of the website
* `<footer>` — for less important information, like the footer of the website, usually includes the copyright statement, social icons, etc.
* `<main>` — for defining the primary content
* `<aside>` — for secondary information, stuff that’s not required to understand the primary content, like sidebars, pull quotes, etc.
* `<section>` — the generic section element
