# Let's start with
My name is...

* Neil Mispelaar
* You can call me "Neil"
* "Professor" works as well

<!--

Slide notes: 

* I'm Neil Mispelaar
* My last name is a bit of pain for people to say so you can just call me Neil 
* That's a picture of me in my Code for Canada jacket - we'll talk more about that later

# Backgrounder 
Where are you from

* Born in India
* Moved to Canada
* Then moved to Zimbabwe
* Then came back to Canada
* Lived in suburban Ottawa
* Then moved downtown

<!-- 

Slide Notes: 

* So, I live in downtown Ottawa, just near Tunney's Pasture
* I love Ottawa, it's a great city, but boy does it have it's challenges (and we can talk about those in a future lesson)
* I was actually born in India (not saying when exactly to avoid aging myself)
* But I spent a lof of formative years in Africa 
* Zimbabwe to be specific 
* Actually, When we came back to Canada I did my post secondary at Algonquin College
* After school I moved to the suburbs, which I really didn't love, and after some big life changes, I ended up moving downtown 
* Which turned out to be the best thing ever because I met my partner Kate
* And that's a picture of our house that we built 
* (Please don't come to my house :-) )

# The fam jam
The other things that I love talking about

* Kate
* Buster
* Brother
* Mom and Dad

<!-- 

Slide Notes: 

* So the most important person in the world for me (apart from all of you ofcourse) is Kate
* Kate and I met seven years ago, dated for two and then married for five 
* This isn't an advertisement or endorsement, but we met on e-harmony, went on one date, and that was it
* Kate's a consultant. She has her own consultancy - and she does feminist research for Governments, Agencies, and companies all over the world
* Kate brought with her, her dog Buster into the relationship
* I was never really a dog person, but dammit Buster melted my heart 
* At first he was a bit like "who is this dude", but now we're best of friends 
* I have one sibling, a younger brother 
* He's an entrepreneur, he actually owns a cannabis store in Kanata South, so that's fun
* And, lastly, my Mom's a teacher in Barrhaven, and my Dad is still in Africa, working as a consultant in Mozambique
