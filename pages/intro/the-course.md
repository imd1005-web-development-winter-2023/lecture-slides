Slide notes: 

* Okay, so here is the list of topics and some of tooling that we are going to cover in the next 13 weeks
* Today we're talking about How the web works
* And in future lessons were going to cover 
  * HTML5 - which is the building blocks of our web pages - how to mark up documents in a compliant way and use all of the sementic tags properly 
  * CSS3 - what we use to style our pages - to be make them really magical with modern CSS
  * and JavaScript - what we use to add important user interactions to our pages
  * We also talk about accessibility (or referred to as "a11y")
  * We'll dive into some modern tech stacks and use libraries like TailwindCSS, VueJS and Nuxt
  * And then we've got a whole list of modern tools that you'll get to use and experiment with. These are the exact same tools you're going to use when you land in industry, so it's really important you get familiar with them now
